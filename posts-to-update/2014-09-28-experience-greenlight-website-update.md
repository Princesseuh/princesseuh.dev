Hi!

This is my first time writing a full English article. English not being
my native language there might be some errors there and there. I'm
sorry! Now that everyone is aware of my bad english we can start this
article!

Before we start talking about my game I would like to inform everyone
that **my website is now fully-translated in English**! There might be
some tiny things not translated but these will be fixed!

Also! I updated some pages on the website to make things clearer. Hope
you guys like the changes! (For the random sentence in the header :
These will NEVER be translated. There's like 300+ sentences in there)

*This awesome logo was made by
[Keranouille](https://twitter.com/Keranouille)! It will be also used as
the new official logo for the game.*

Around a month ago I released my game SinaRun 2 (which will be renamed
to 'SinaRun' very soon) on
[Itch.io](http://princesseuh.itch.io/sinarun-2),
[Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=302937944)
and some days after
[IndieGameStand](https://indiegamestand.com/store/1190/sinarun-2/)! The
game did okay! Well maybe not by the standard but since this is my first
commercial game it did okay enough for me! **Only 48h after the release
I was at 40-50%~ of the way to the Top 100 on Greenlight.**

<!-- more -->

That's pretty awesome.. Want to know what's even more awesome? Some days
after the release youtubers, bloggers and even publishers started
contacting me! **Wow.** People weren't that interested in my games
before but hey that's awesome! So here we are now.. People like my game!
(I said no to the publisher because I didn't like the contract and
anyway.. Being Indie is awesome!)

**We are now the 3 September (13 days after the release).** I receive a
mail from Thomas Brooke, CEO and Founder of
[Groupees.com](https://groupees.com/) (a game bundle website). My game
is okay enough to be included in a bundle? That's pretty nice! Meanwhile
the Greenlight was going very well. When Thomas first contacted me
SinaRun was at **70%**~ of the way to the Top 100!

**10 September (20 days after the release) : The game was at 81% of the
way to the Top 100 on Greenlight and the bundle launched!** This bundle
had a special 'preorder' thing where you could preorder the bundle for
only 1.50$! 3300~ Bundles were sold during that special 'preorder'
state. That's pretty cool! 3300~ people now have my game in their
library! **The Bundle REALLY helped. 1-2 days after the Bundle I was in
the Top 100 on Greenlight.**

And then.. 8 days after the Bundle launch.. **SinaRun get Greenlit! (28
days after the release)** I'm not gonna lie I was QUITE happy about the
situation. Greenlit under one month for a game that was not popular at
all least than a month before? Also I wasn't expecting it to get
Greenlit (or at least not that fast) since the game is designed to only
appeal to a specific type of people. **The game was #41 on Greenlight
when it got Greenlit.**

A big **thanks** to everyone for voting for the game on Greenlight. Thank you to
everyone who supported me!
