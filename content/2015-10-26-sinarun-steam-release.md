Heeello everyone!

Yeah sorry I already broke my new rule of starting post with 'hai!'.
It's not like it's the first time I'm breaking promises though.. What
happened to SinaRun you might ask? 'It's releasing in July' you said! Yeah. It was
actually okayish. Like it was still bad! But it was better than it used
to.

Anyway! Let put all that behind us. I'd rather not be remembered as
that guy that got Chronique de Solaria's (It's an inside joke with my
good friend FoxFiesta.) Oh yeah talking about FoxFiesta! What a man. How
can one man be so based you might ask? Well look at that

Yep. That's right. **SinaRun is finally coming out.** Actually it's
releasing tomorrow. In 15 hours! (I should have done that post earlier
this week I think.. Damn.) and it's releasing in that weird thing that
people don't remember when good games go through it. Also known as
**EARLY ACCESS!** (the demon!)

*Talking about the wolf..*

**Why?** Well. SinaRun is one fine piece of a game but that's exactly
the problem. It's only one piece! The mechanics are obviously done but
the game could use more content! More Levels! More Gamemodes! More
things as a whole! Don't get me wrong the actual content is already
pretty cool but it could certainly use.. more awesome things!

Right now what's the state of the game you says? Well it work for
starter. There's 16 levels, a online multiplayer that (kinda?) work and
online leaderboards powered by Steam! If you like this type of game,
manage to find a map you like and there's enough competition on the
leaderboard **you could last at least 10-20 hours?** I know some of my
testers have around 30~ hours

**The game will cost 2.99$ USD and there's currently no price change
planned** Considering the actual content of the game that's a pretty
cool price. Considering it's my type of game I would most certainly buy
it if I saw it on Steam!

Releasing on Steam also means expanding our community! Most people in
the 'community' (as small as it can be) right now are pretty cool so
let's keep it that way uh? **Some days ago I also opened a SinaRun
Subreddit** which you can find here : <https://www.reddit.com/r/sinarun>
.

Currently it's kinda empty and feature the default Reddit theme BUUUUT
I'll work on it after the release and I hope together we can attempt to
make some kind of community on there!

**Patches, news and everything suitable I can find will be posted
there** so if you're a Reddit user, like SinaRun and would like to have
the news when they come this is one of the best place to follow. [(My
Twitter being the best)](https://twitter.com/Princesseuh). There's also
a link to the subreddit [(and my
Twitter!)](https://twitter.com/Princesseuh) in every single menu of the
game so it shouldn't be hard to make people come.

I really hope some kind of community manage to be form around the game
be it on the Subreddit [(or on my
Twitter!)](https://twitter.com/Princesseuh). **It would be incredibly
cool to have people sharing their routes, techniques and stuff!**
(Though I know sharing advanced techniques in a game based around
simplicity is weird I'm sure you guys will eventually find things to
do.)

And that's pretty much it for the SinaRun release for the moment. I'll
post about my progress, intentions and others things when these are
ready (hint : Steam Achievement, remake of multiplayer and more!)

Thanks for taking interest in the game.
