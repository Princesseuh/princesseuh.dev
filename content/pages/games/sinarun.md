**SinaRun** is a minimalist 3D platform/racing
game for PC.

The goal? Simply make the best time! What makes you different from the
other players is not the cheap abilities you can get on the playground.
It's how good you will be at optimizing jumps, turns and general
route-finding.

The game is designed to not lead the players toward any levels. While
all levels are (currently) pretty similar all levels feature slight
changes in gameplay. Do you like small and quick jumps? Maybe you prefer
bigger levels with turns and falls? What about sliding?

There's most likely a level you will like. At least I hope so! (If not
please post in the forum and I'll see what I can do)

Find a level you like, play it hundreds of times and eventually maybe be
the best on the leaderboard!

### Current Features :
-   16+ Levels with multiple paths. Finding a good route is the first
    step toward a good time!
-   Leaderboards (Beat your friends or compete in the global leaderboard)
-   Online Multiplayer (Server browser, join your friends etc.)
-   Music by the awesome [General Fuzz](http://generalfuzz.com/) (Early Access Trailer Music by [Keffy Kay](http://keffykay.com/))
-   Steam Trading cards
