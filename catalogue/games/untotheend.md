This game BLEW my mind, it blew my mind so much [I tweeted(!) about it](https://twitter.com/_princesseuh/status/1367540286478499849)! That's rare!

It was really hard, it was really rough, it was painful, it was exciting, it was poetic, it was everything. So so so SO good, everything I wanted in a video game.

Probably the most impressed I've been by a video game since Dark Souls 1 or Else Heart.Break()
