Really disliked this, the gameplay wasn't as fun as the previous ones and the story was.. a lot, in a negative kind of way. The game took control from me extremely often which I heavily disliked

It was really pretty though, unfortunate that it's kinda all it had going for it. I ended up rushing through the game a lot, wanting to get it over with as quickly as possible
