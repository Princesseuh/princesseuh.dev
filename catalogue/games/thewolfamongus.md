Replayed this with my partner as I've already played it back in 2014. It definitely still holds up, probably more so than the other Telltales from this era. Aside from a few technical issues we didn't have any problems

It was really fun to see my partner theorize about the ending - just like we all did when it came out. A shame there won't be an answer ever

You're not as bad as everyone says you are, Bigby
