This is my partner's favorite book so it's only natural that they shared it with me and wanted me to read it

I didn't wow me as much as it did for them unfortunately. I think it's probably due to wrong expectations because the book is good. I was really into it and really wanted to see what was next but ultimately, I felt like the book was a bit too "simple" and idealistic?

The message of the book, to me at least, is that everyone can do good, you don't have to be special or the greatest person, you just need to do it. But, I think an interesting aspect that I felt wasn't touched on enough is that Ed doesn't fix problems for the most part, he just makes things easier in the moment sometimes

This was touched on in certain cases (Angie's kids are still a lot of her, Milla won't ever remember much etc) but in other cases, it felt like the passing of Ed just fixed everything and I ended up not always sure what the message behind each character was. It didn't help that the author in this tend to put a lot of stray sentences alone to give a certain impact to the writing, I didn't mind it as much as some people did but it did feel a bit cheap at times

But, just like my partner tells me, I'm probably overthinking it and things are just.. simple sometimes. Maybe it's just about remembering your potential even when you consider yourself not much and how much a stranger (or friend) can help. I'll remember this book
