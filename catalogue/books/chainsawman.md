I overall liked this! It had been a while since I last read a manga, especially a shonen like this one and ended up really pleasantly surprised

The characters were nice (Power is best girl), the action was really impressive. Some part were a bit too shonen for me and naming all the character "Thing Devil" was a bit.. funny at time but overall it was fun

And obviously, woof woof
